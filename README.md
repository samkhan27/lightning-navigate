# lightning-navigate
A lightning component to demonstrate how to use the lightning navigate and workspace API. 


This repo provides an example of how to use the lightning navigation and workspaceApi service components to navigate inside LEX.
THe example use case shown here is that of an anchor tag that enables an user to navigate to a particular record. 

This is a common use case for a lot of clients and the usually the requirements are as follows:

 - Right clicking will open the record view page in a new tab. 
 - If console navigation is enabled, then the rocord page should open in a new console tab.
 - If console navigation is not enabled, clicking should navigate to the record view page in LEX in the current tab.
